## 🌱 Inspiration  

Starting college means being surrounded by thousands of new faces, but actually turning those faces into friendships? That’s awkward and intimidating.  

We realized every student already has a **class schedule** — so why not make it the easiest way to connect?  

That’s where **Skedulr** comes in.
