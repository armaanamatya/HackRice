## 🎯 **Key Features Demonstrated**

### **Smart AI Integration**
- Uses Google's latest Gemini 1.5 Flash model
- Sophisticated prompting for structured JSON output
- Rate My Professor data aggregation
- Industry-relevant career analysis

### **Performance Optimization**
- 24-hour caching reduces API costs
- Sub-second response for cached reports
- Automatic stale report cleanup
- Graceful fallback for failed API calls

### **Professional UX**
- One-click report generation
- Beautiful loading animations
- Interactive data visualizations
- Mobile-responsive design

## 🛠️ **Technical Highlights**

### **Robust Error Handling**
```javascript
// Smart JSON parsing with fallback
try {
    reportData = JSON.parse(text);
} catch (parseError) {
    // Extract from markdown blocks
    const jsonMatch = text.match(/```(?:json)?\s*([\s\S]*?)\s*```/) || 
                     text.match(/{[\s\S]*}/);
    if (jsonMatch) {
        reportData = JSON.parse(jsonMatch[1] || jsonMatch[0]);
    }
}
```

### **Intelligent Caching Strategy**
```javascript
// Dual-layer caching system
- Memory cache: Instant access for active reports
- File system cache: Persistent storage across restarts  
- Automatic cleanup: Stale reports removed automatically
- Cache management API: Manual cache control when needed
```

### **Visual Data Display**
```css
/* Dynamic difficulty meters */
.meter-fill {
    width: ${(rating/10)*100}%;
    background: ${getDifficultyColor(rating)};
    transition: width 0.5s ease;
}

/* Star ratings */
.star.full { color: #fbbf24; }
.star.empty { color: #d1d5db; }
```
